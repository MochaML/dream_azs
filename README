TODO:
+ remove insensitive (high viability at max kill) / highly varying (sd of synergy) cell lines 
+ feature selection (remove correlated)
+ handling missing values (either dont use them or imppute them, eg., kNN=5)
+ using drug similarity (target or formula) as feature
+ using pathway & cosmic genes as features
+ imputation w/o synergy
+ use all training data set (better)
? using disease similarity (gexp correlation) as feature
?correction for cell / drug drift (overall high / low)
- cell line based drifts for confidence scoring (e.g., penalize 
insensitive / high Einf cell lines)
- using 0/1 scheme for ch2
+ shifting to categorized features (muts at pathway genes A B C: 0 1 1)
o GUILD scoring for drugs (targets) for each cell line using gexp as 
seed score, overlap at 1-5% / coverage of KEGG pathways (or n.comm pathways) at top
? features from ncomm paper, not cell line specific (ppi distance between targets / degree of targets)

=> gexp target categorized 35.6 (from 22 of non-categorized)
=> + mut target categorized 38.2 (from 35.6 of gexp)
=> gexp categorized only 35.4 (forget about mXXX, "gexp", "mut")
=> cnv only "c" 41.6
=> cnv both "c" and "z" 38.3
=> g/c/p 35 - 36.3 (including correlated)
=> g/c 36.6
=> c/p 41.6
