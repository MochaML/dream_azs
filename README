TODO:
- remove insensitive (high viability at max kill) / highly varying (sd of synergy) cell lines 
- feature selection (remove correlated)
- handling missing values (either dont use them or imppute them, eg., kNN=5)
- correction for cell / drug drift (overall high / low)
- using pathway & cosmic genes as features
- using drug similarity (target or formula) as feature
- using disease similarity (gexp correlation) as feature
- use all training data set
