TODO:
+ remove insensitive (high viability at max kill) / highly varying (sd of synergy) cell lines 
+ feature selection (remove correlated)
+ handling missing values (either dont use them or imppute them, eg., kNN=5)
+ using drug similarity (target or formula) as feature
+ using pathway & cosmic genes as features
+ imputation w/o synergy
+ use all training data set (better)
? using disease similarity (gexp correlation) as feature
? correction for cell / drug drift (overall high / low)
+ using 0/1 scheme for ch2
+ shifting to categorized features (muts at pathway genes A B C: 0 1 1)
+ SEA / HitPick predictions, removing drugs w/o target info from training
+ features from ncomm paper, not cell line specific (ppi distance between targets / degree of targets)
+ cell line avg synergy based weights / drug combination avg synergy based features (no improvement)
+ correct missing similiarity combinations and cell line comb id integer conversion in process
+ recheck filtering (keep high synergy cutoff=+-5) - no imporvement / filter NAs for cnv
+ redefine monotherapy response features (difference of A-B)
+ check R scoring scripts
+ check different models / consider only using RF
- correct 1(0)/2(1) issue in ch2 output
- cell line based drifts for confidence scoring (e.g., penalize insensitive / high Einf cell lines)
? confidence based on random model 
o GUILD scoring for drugs (targets) for each cell line using gexp as 
seed score, overlap at 1-5% / coverage of KEGG pathways (or n.comm pathways) at top
- ch2 model with glmnet or cnv/2 + cosmic/2 + guild.med + guild.max
- guild top 500 vs 1000
- building a classifier using gexp etc data to predict monotherapy response to be used in ch2
