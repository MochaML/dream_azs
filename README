TODO:
+ remove insensitive (high viability at max kill) / highly varying (sd of synergy) cell lines 
+ feature selection (remove correlated)
+ handling missing values (either dont use them or imppute them, eg., kNN=5)
+ using drug similarity (target or formula) as feature
+ using pathway & cosmic genes as features
+ imputation w/o synergy
+ use all training data set
? using disease similarity (gexp correlation) as feature
?correction for cell / drug drift (overall high / low)
- cell line based drifts for confidence scoring (e.g., penalize insensitive / high Einf cell lines)
- using 0/1 scheme for ch2
