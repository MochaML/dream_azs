TODO:
+ remove insensitive (high viability at max kill) / highly varying (sd of synergy) cell lines 
+ feature selection (remove correlated)
+ handling missing values (either dont use them or imppute them, eg., kNN=5)
+ using drug similarity (target or formula) as feature
+ using pathway & cosmic genes as features
+ imputation w/o synergy
+ use all training data set
? using disease similarity (gexp correlation) as feature
?correction for cell / drug drift (overall high / low)
- cell line based drifts for confidence scoring (e.g., penalize 
insensitive / high Einf cell lines)
- using 0/1 scheme for ch2
- shifting to categorized features (muts at pathway genes A B C: 0 1 1)
- novel features from ncomm paper
- GUILD scoring for drugs (targets) for each cell line using gexp as 
seed score, overlap at 1-5% / coverage of KEGG pathways (or n.comm pathways) at top
- ppi distance between targets
- degree of targets

=> gexp target categorized 35.6 (from 22 of non-categorized)
